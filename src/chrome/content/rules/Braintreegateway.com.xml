<!--
     preload rule in the Chromium/Firefox browser.  See
     https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.h
     for the list of preloads. Sites are added to the Chromium HSTS
     preload list on request from their administrators, so HTTPS should
     work properly everywhere on this site.

     Because the Tor Browser uses an outdated version of the list
     this rule applies only to Firefox.
     See https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16584
     The rule can be removed when this was fixed.
